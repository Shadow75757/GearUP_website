## Overview

This website consists of multiple pages, each addressing different key aspects of our project. We utilized various programming languages and technologies, including:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- MySQL

The website also aggregates all the social media accounts developed as part of the project, allowing external visitors to discover more about **GearUP**.

## Initial Steps

At the outset, our team had limited web design experience. To bridge this gap, we followed a tutorial by **Brian Designs** on YouTube. The tutorial provided a foundational understanding of creating key website components, such as:

- Header
- Footer
- Base layout with cards and images

After completing the tutorial and gaining a solid grasp of the concepts, we proceeded to adapt the design to better fit our theme and project goals.

## Design Philosophy

Our design is inspired by the look and feel of **high-performance sports cars**. We incorporated the following design elements:

- **Vibrant Red (`#FF0000`)**: Represents speed, passion, and intensity.
- **Carbon Fiber Textures**: Associated with strength, performance, and exclusivity in the automotive world.

This combination of vibrant red and carbon fiber creates a visually striking and elegant interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Logo Development

Using **Canvas Premium**, we designed 26 different logo options. After careful consideration, we narrowed it down to five final choices, which are attached in the appendix of our report.

## Development Process

### Front-End and Back-End

Our approach prioritized **front-end development** to ensure a strong visual identity before tackling the back-end. The primary structure of each page consists of:

- **Header**
- **Main content area**
- **Footer**

We also ensured that the design was **responsive**, adapting smoothly to different screen sizes.

### Custom CSS

Most of the styling was hand-written without relying on frameworks like Bootstrap.
